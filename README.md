# OpenShift Cloud Creds

Cloud Creds is a controller that will sync on a CredentailsRequest custom resource definition. CredentialsRequests allow OpenShift components to request fine grained credentials in a particular cloud provider. These credentials will be generated by a more powerful set of credentials. The controller is being written such that it can run in cluster, implying that your powerful cloud credentials (capable of creating more credentials) live in a secret in your cluster, *or* run in a centralized management cluster creating credentials on your cluster's behalf. (most likely alongside (Hive)[https://github.com/openshift/hive]).

## AWS

Currently AWS is the only supported cloud provider. If running in-cluster, your credentials are expected to exist in kube-system/aws-creds with the keys aws_access_key_id and aws_secret_access_key.

# Running

Currently the controller can only be run locally when you are logged in with admin credentials.

```
$ make install
$ make run
```

# Future Work

  1. Integration with the OpenShift Installer.
  1. Cloud Creds Operator.
  1. CI + dist-git image publishing.
